If you would like to use non-default extensions you can use the following (nix) syntax in place of `php` in devbox.json:\n\n(php.withExtensions ({ enabled, all }: enabled ++ (with all; [ ext1 ext2 ])))\n\nFor example, adding memcached and ds to php81 looks like:\n\n(php81.withExtensions ({ enabled, all }: enabled ++ (with all; [ memcached ds ])))"
